## Overview

In this repository, you will find the essential steps to perform **supervised learning** tasks, specifically focusing on **regression models** like Decision Trees. The steps include data loading, transformation, visualization, feature reduction, model building, evaluation, and iteration.

This repository is **beginner-friendly** and provides the necessary tools to get started with **AI** and **Machine Learning** in Python.

## AI/ML Life Cycle Steps

### 1. **Loading the Data**
   - **Objective**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and exploration.
   - You can use various formats like CSV, Excel, etc. Below is a general approach for loading data in **CSV** format.
   
   ```bash
   # Import necessary library
   import pandas as pd
   
   # Load the dataset into a DataFrame
   data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your-dataset.csv')
   
   # View the first few rows of the dataset
   data.head()
  ```

### 2. **Data Transformation**
  - **Objective**: Clean and transform the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if necessary.
  - You can use tools like LabelEncoder for encoding categorical features or StandardScaler for scaling the data.
    
  ```bash
  # Fill missing values with the mean of each column
  data.fillna(value=data.mean(), inplace=True)
  
  # Encode categorical variables (example: date)
  from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
  le = LabelEncoder()
  data['date'] = le.fit_transform(data['date'])
  ```

### 3. **Data Visualization**
  - **Objective**: Visualize the data to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies.
  - Use libraries like seaborn and matplotlib to create plots such as heatmaps, histograms, and scatter plots.

  ```bash
  # Import necessary libraries
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
  # Plot a heatmap to visualize correlations
  corr = data.corr()
  sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
  plt.show()
  ```

### 4. **Feature Reduction (Optional)**
  - **Objective**: Reduce the dimensionality of your dataset if you have many features. This step is often done using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  PCA helps retain the most important information while reducing the number of features.

  ```bash
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
  
  # Initialize PCA to reduce dimensions
  pca = PCA(n_components=10)
  
  # Apply PCA to the dataset
  pca_data = pca.fit_transform(data.drop(['target'], axis=1))
  ```

### 5. **Building the Model**
  - **Objective**: Choose an appropriate machine learning model. For regression tasks, you may use Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regression, etc.
  - Below is a general example of using DecisionTreeRegressor:

  ```bash
  from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
  
  # Initialize the model
  model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
  
  # Train the model on your training data
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  
  # Make predictions
  y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
  ```

### 6. **Evaluating the Model**
  - **Objective**: Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics such as R² score, mean squared error, etc.
  - Use evaluation metrics to understand how well your model is performing.

#### **For Regressor Models**:
  - **R² Score**: A measure of how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

  ```bash
  # Import necessary evaluation metrics for regression
  from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
  
  # For regression models like DecisionTreeRegressor, etc.
  # Assuming `y_pred` is the predicted values and `y_test` is the true target values
  
  # Calculate R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
  mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
  
  # Print the results
  print(f'R² Score: {r2}')
  print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
  ```

#### **For Classifier Models**:
  - **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
  - **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
  - **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
  - **F1 Score**: A weighted average of Precision and Recall. Useful when you need a balance between Precision and Recall.

  ```bash
  # Import necessary evaluation metrics for classification
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
  
  # For classification models like Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.
  # Assuming `y_pred` is the predicted class labels and `y_test` is the true class labels
  
  # Calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
  accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
  precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
  recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
  f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
  
  # Print the results
  print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
  print(f'Precision: {precision}')
  print(f'Recall: {recall}')
  print(f'F1 Score: {f1}')
  ```

#### **Key Differences in Metrics**:
  - **Regression** (e.g., DecisionTreeRegressor): We focus on continuous output, and metrics like R² and MSE are used to evaluate how close the predictions are to the actual continuous values.
  - **Classification** (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN): We focus on predicting discrete classes, so metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score are used to measure how well the model performs in classifying data into the correct categories.

### 7. **Model Deployment and Iteration**
  - **Objective**: Once the model performs well, it can be deployed for real-world predictions. Continuously monitor the model and improve it by experimenting with different algorithms, parameters, or additional features.

## **Types of Data**

### **Supervised Learning**
  - **Definition**: In supervised learning, the dataset contains labeled data, meaning the target variable (the outcome you're trying to predict) is known. The model is trained to learn a mapping from input features to the target variable.
  - **Common Algorithms**:
    - **Regression**: For predicting continuous values (e.g., predicting house prices or stock prices).
    - **Classification**: For predicting discrete classes or categories (e.g., detecting spam emails or classifying diseases).
  - **Use in This Repository**: This repository mainly deals with **supervised learning regression tasks** (i.e., predicting continuous outcomes).

### **Unsupervised Learning**
  - **Definition**: In unsupervised learning, the dataset does not contain labels (i.e., the target variable is unknown). The goal is to identify hidden patterns or structures in the data without prior knowledge of the outcomes.
  - **Common Techniques**:
    - **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points into clusters (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN).
    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in the dataset while maintaining essential information (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
  - **Use in Modern Frameworks**: Techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction are often implemented in popular frameworks such as **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.

## **Regressor vs Classifier**

### **Regressor**
  - **Definition**: A **regressor** is a model used to predict continuous values (real numbers). These models are used when the target variable is a quantity.
  - **Example Use Cases**:
    - Predicting house prices, temperature, or sales figures.
  - **Common Examples**: 
    - Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor.

### **Classifier**
  - **Definition**: A **classifier** is a model used to predict discrete categories or classes. These models are used when the target variable is a category or class label.
  - **Example Use Cases**:
    - Spam detection, disease diagnosis, or image classification.
  - **Common Examples**:
    - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM).
